# Mouse following eyes

Done with pure JavaScript and HTML.  
Eyes are drawn on canvas and the right direction is calculated by getting the vector from eye center to mouse xy coordinates.  
From there we can calculate the unit vector and then scale that to desired length. End point of that vector is where we want to 
place our pupil.
